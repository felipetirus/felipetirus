Receita da Jelena

## Ingredients

* TODO

## Directions

1. The main meal, I fried one cut onion in a bit of oil and added 
frozen vegetables (oriental mix/Chinese mix) had around 1 kg frozen vegetables. 
In one mug I mixed soya sauce, honey (it was around 4 small spoons, teaspoons) 
and 2 small spoons of corn starch (also from Polish shop, but I think you can find in Tesco as well). 
When vegetables were almost ready I added that sauce. 
It will start to starch and become solid so then you add water to be the consistency you wish. 
You can add other spices then, I add pepper and vegeta (you can add salt). 
A few minutes before the end I added chickpeas from a can. 
And at serving, I add cashew on the top.
